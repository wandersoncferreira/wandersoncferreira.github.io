        <h1>Summary readings: March - April 2020</h1><time>April 28, 2020</time></header><p>I follow <a href="https://eli.thegreenplace.net/">Eli Bendersky</a> blog and he
produces a very simple and not so detailed summary of all his book
readings from time to time. This is very useful because I like to read
and one of the most difficult tasks for me is searching <em>what</em> to read
(you know, time is limited).</p>
<p>Therefore, I decided to do the same. I also try to keep track of my
<em>to-read</em> and <em>read</em> books since 2016 at
<a href="https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/85018850-wanderson-ferreira">Goodreads</a>,
I hope to help someone else choosing the next book.</p>

<li>
<p>I postponed this reading for a long time, but what a bad decision!.
This book is very nice! As a previous (geo)physicist student, I very
often you read and listened about the great work of some scientists
and Feynman was definitely one of them.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>I study at Universidade de São Paulo and Feynman came to Brazil and
was there for a while (there is even a chapter about that!!) so he was
<em>the</em> figure!</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>This book shows how <em>human</em> Feynman was! He had an incredible
curiosity and willpower to act upon his experiments. So many funny
histories.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>He described one of this presentation about his academic work and on
the audience was Einstein, Oppenheimer, Norris Russell, von Neumann,
and many others. Wow! I personally relate to that because in 2014 I
presented my findings in Houston to many great geophysicist that I had
only met before by reading their work on journals. The feeling is
great, rush of adrenaline when you start talking about the subject
that you have been investigating for 2 years in a row .. you <em>think</em>
you are the expert.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<blockquote>
<p>So I have just one wish to you &ndash; the good luck to be somewhere
where you are free to maintain the kind of integrity I have described,
and where you do not feel forced by a need to maintain your position
in the organization, or financial support, or so on, to lose your
integrity. May you have that freedom.</p>

<li>
<p>More detail and technical explanation about the components involved
at <em>solving problems</em> such as <em>memory</em>, <em>proper problem
representation</em>, <em>learning</em>, <em>creativity</em> and <em>decision making</em>.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>It is indeed interesting, but I think if you are into some of these
subjects you already know 80% of this book. However, if you are only
interested in starting, this is a very dense read. Therefore, I do not
find it worthy.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>There is a nice study about creativity though.</p>
</li>

genius. They <em>do not</em> mean that just anyone with 10 to 25 years of

endowed with the genius of Mozart or Beethoven will need 10 years
or more of intense preparation to be creative.</p>

<li>
<p>Easy and good to read, the message is harsh towards <em>programmer&rsquo;s
profissionalism</em> and very eye opener.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>It starts with a history about a project where the business manager
was paired up with the technical leader and they were kicking in all
the obstacles to deliver all the features, working really intense
hours to deliver on time.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>However, at the release date the <em>legal department</em> could not
finish a necessary contract to go live.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The technical leader says to the business manager: &ldquo;ok, let&rsquo;s do our
thing again and go there and ask them to finish this two pages by the
end of the day!&rdquo; and the answer caught the technical leader with great
surprise: <em>&ldquo;we cannot do this, they are real professionals&rdquo;</em></p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Wait a moment! Wait a moment&hellip;!! What am I? Wait a moment.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The software development <em>has</em> processes, rituals and ways at we
can act and perform like professionals and most of the time we <em>should
not violate</em> these <em>principles</em> because of our work ethics.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>We might negotiate with business people the correct estimates to
deliver everything, and we <em>are</em> professionals, we <em>want</em> to deliver
the product, we are a member of this organization, we work on the
company&rsquo;s side. There are no reasons for me to be lying.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>This is difficult. Because the developers itself does not take
themselves serious enough, how can the management do it so?</p>
</li>

<li>
<p>Sometimes is not clear to people when I say that I am studying
Clojure. The language itself has lots of interesting bits, but very
often the subjects that interest me most are the reasoning behind
how Clojure was design and how it is used.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Fogus goes deep in each aspect of the language and provides several
valuable references to papers or books in order to improve our
understanding about the concepts.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The fact that Clojure was designed &ldquo;by/to experienced programmers&rdquo;
makes it very interesting to me. I haven&rsquo;t participated in
communities with such a high quality discussions and support.</p>

<li>
<p>Very easy read, Marcus Aurelius was an Roman Emperor and also a
Stoic Philosopher.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>I read this book right after reading the <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Zen-Mind-Beginners-Informal-Meditation-ebook/dp/B00I8USOM0/ref=pd_sbsd_14_1/136-4339934-2460642?_encoding=UTF8&amp;pd_rd_i=B00I8USOM0&amp;pd_rd_r=e82a0562-5bc2-496b-aeff-ddef62decae3&amp;pd_rd_w=wzsZ2&amp;pd_rd_wg=TNaZz&amp;pf_rd_p=2c2d0d3b-b3c5-4110-93fa-2c1270309ac1&amp;pf_rd_r=ZG3N26GRJBCNETGJ5XTD&amp;psc=1&amp;refRID=ZG3N26GRJBCNETGJ5XTD">Zen
Mind</a>,
which is a book about Zen Practice and Buddhism, and I was astonished
to notice so many similarities.</p>

<p>This is basically a Twitter Account from 120d.C. Amazing to see how
he thinks and his priorities back them, also some chad of light about
society. You should definitely read it.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Remember two things:</p>

<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>that everything has always been the same, and keeps recurring,
and it makes no difference whether you see the same things recur in
a hundred years or two hundred, or in an infinite period;</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>that the longest-lived and those who will die soonest lose the
same thing. The present is all that they can give up, since that is
all you have, and what you do not have you cannot lose.</li>
</ul>
