<p>I follow <a href="https://eli.thegreenplace.net/">Eli Bendersky</a> blog, and he
produces a very simple and not so detailed summary of all his book
readings from time to time. This is very useful because I like to read
and one of the most difficult tasks for me is searching <em>what</em> to read
(you know, time is limited).</p>
<p>Therefore, I decided to do the same. I also try to keep track of my
<em>to-read</em> and <em>read</em> books since 2016 at
<a href="https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/85018850-wanderson-ferreira">Goodreads</a>,
I hope to help someone else choosing the next book.</p>

<h2 id="1-invisible-cities">1. Invisible Cities</h2>
<blockquote>
<p>This said, it is pointless trying to decide whether Zenobia is to be
classified among happy cities or among the unhappy. It makes no
sense to divide cities into these two species, but rather into
another two: those that through the years and the changes continue
to give their form to desires, and those in which desires either
erase the city or are erased by it.</p>

<li>
<p>Very different book, it is about an Emperor that is owner of a vast
realm, and he personally does not know all the cities, thus he has
explorers to visit the cities and came back describing it.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>However, the descriptions from Marco Polo are very unusual, we are
invited to look at the real elements that constitute the city
metaphor e.g. people, culture, relationships, believes, tradition,
etc.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Several cities shared similarities with so many “cities”
I lived inside São Paulo.</p>

<h2 id="2-the-nonexisting-knight">2. The Nonexisting Knight</h2>
<blockquote>
<p>&ldquo;What d&rsquo;you expect to be sure of? [&hellip;]. Insignia, ranks, titles
. . . All mere show. Those paladins&rsquo; shields with armorial bearings
and mottoes are not made of iron; they&rsquo;re just paper, you can put
your finger through them.&rdquo;</p>

<li>Would read again? Sure!</li>
</ul>
<p> </p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>The book tells the history of Agilulf which is a pristine knight!
He is the perfect knight, everything is done correctly and
precisely, he knows all the rules and protocols and never fail any
assignment.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The idea of the tale is to confront the notion of identity. What we
find out by looking at Agilulf is very sad because we realize that
following rules, and optimizing around made up concepts and
protocols is very easy and you can perform all these tasks very
precisely without thinking too much about “why” questions.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>I made a connection with another subject I read in the past called
<strong>”Bad Faith”</strong> by the French philosopher Jean-Paul Sartre. Living
in “bad faith” is lying to yourself about your options, “things
must be this way”, “this is my destiny”, and so on. accordingly, to
Sartre, bad faith happens as an alternative to the scare notion of
Freedom.</p>

<h2 id="3-the-tao-of-microservices">3. The Tao of Microservices</h2>
<blockquote>
<p>But concepts are useless without practice. You can&rsquo;t understand how
to build software in a new way, without building software in a new
way.</p>

<li>Would read again? As soon as I need to work on Microservice again</li>
</ul>
<p> </p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>After two years searching / reading about MS, this is probably one
of the best books/resources I found so far. The book is an
“experience report” from the author last 6 years building
microservices in the real world.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>As everything in software, this is not the only way or the “right”
way, but has several discussions about trade-offs you will
eventually need to make if you go down this road.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>I have several footnotes in the book pages that I wish I could
discuss further with the author, this is my feature request for
books in the future.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p> </p>
<h2 id="4-release-it">4. Release It!</h2>
<blockquote>
<p>Some software exists as art and some exists as entertainment. Most
of the software we write for companies exists to create economic
value. We should build our systems with transparency in terms of
revealing the way that the recent past, current state, and future
state connect to revenue and costs.</p>

<li>Rate: 4/5</li>
<li>Would read again? Not cover-to-cover, but as reference guide</li>
</ul>
<p> </p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>The book presents several topics for running software in production
for real companies based on a series of Case Studies.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>I find very useful to read about experience reports because there
are very wild situations that only happen in production after years
of development. This problem might be related to what Joe Armstrong
describes in <a href="https://youtu.be/lKXe3HUG2l4?t=879">The Mess We&rsquo;re
In</a> when he talks about the
incredible number of possible states a computer can be at any given
time. That&rsquo;s one of the reason you can&rsquo;t fully reproduce the same
bug twice in many situations.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p> </p>
<h2 id="5-masters-of-doom-how-two-guys-created-an-empire-and-transformed-pop-culture">5. Masters of Doom: How Two Guys Created An Empire And Transformed Pop Culture</h2>
<blockquote>
<p>&ldquo;In the information age, the barriers just aren&rsquo;t there&rdquo;, he
said. &ldquo;The barriers are self-imposed. If you want to set off and go
develop some grand new thing, you don&rsquo;t need millions of dollars of
capitalization. You need enough pizza and Diet Coke to stick in your
refrigerator, a cheap PC to work on, and the dedication to go
through with it.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>&ndash; John Carmack</p>

<li>
<p>The content of the book is very good, however I think I lost the
passion for books written in J.R.R Tolkien style. Lots of details
about the whole scene. I also understand that this style portrait
the exact situation of the Game industry back at that time and how
two guys could deliver a bunch of innovative solutions.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Even though the book mentions other works being developed at
Universities and other places, the power of John Carmack and John
Romero was to be able to ship code! To make that thing useful in
some context and to never give up.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>I wonder if the game industry today has similar working conditions
to their employees but without the appropriate upside.</p>
</li>
</ol>

<h2 id="6-head-first-design-patterns">6. Head First Design Patterns</h2>
<blockquote>
<p>A Pattern is a solution to a problem in a given context.</p>

<p> </p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>This was in my waiting list since 2015. The book is indeed very
interesting and it has very nice ideas about how to approach the
design of your problem space to enable more flexibility, and less
friction.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Even though I use Functional Languages in my daily job, I
understand a lot of valuable concepts behind OOP that should be
used anyway e.g. composition, dependency inversion, program towards
interfaces to name a few.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>I even created a
<a href="https://github.com/wandersoncferreira/hfdp">repository</a> to
implement all the examples from the book in Clojure with a Java
accent.</p>
</li>
