- pay attention to what is hidden
- attending to contrary evidence
- seek falsification
- write comments about what is not in the code: intentions and assumptions
- understanding by breaking
- re-assessing the landscape and deliberately expanding the search space
- sometimes a high performance team avoids using methodologies
- playing methods against each other
  - building errors into the code to verify the test suite etc
- the interplay between developers is crucial
- experts use disciplined practices that are socially embedded and reinforced
- contrasting multiple perspectives
  - fixes the problem and not worries about the *blame*
