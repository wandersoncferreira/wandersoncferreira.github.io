<p>focus can be defined as the ability to carefully pay attention to something such
as a task or a person.</p>
<p>it requires a lot of <a href=https://wandersoncferreira.github.io/home/bartuka/code/roam/notes/20240915190218-reference-missing/>concentration</a>.</p>
<p>in the world of <a href=/home/bartuka/code/roam/notes/20240614214250-sport-psychologist/>sport psycology</a>, focus is a critical skill that must
be mastered by all athletes that desire to exceed in their role. for my
particular scenario at <a href=https://wandersoncferreira.github.io/home/bartuka/code/roam/notes/20240915190218-reference-missing/>running</a>, there are some key moments that i really need to
focus on the task at hand:</p>
<ol>
<li><a href=https://wandersoncferreira.github.io/home/bartuka/code/roam/notes/20240915190218-reference-missing/>race</a>s</li>
<li>the <a href=https://wandersoncferreira.github.io/home/bartuka/code/roam/notes/20240915190218-reference-missing/>long run</a></li>
<li>regular workouts such as sprints</li>
</ol>
<p>it is very important to keep myself concentrated and <a href=https://wandersoncferreira.github.io/home/bartuka/code/roam/notes/20240915190218-reference-missing/>present</a> in the moment
when i am realizing these activities. therefore, i do not listen to music,
podcasts, etc. i try to minimize all <a href=https://wandersoncferreira.github.io/home/bartuka/code/roam/notes/20240915190218-reference-missing/>distractions</a> that i can <a href=https://wandersoncferreira.github.io/home/bartuka/code/roam/notes/20240915190218-reference-missing/>control</a> to build
this <a href=https://wandersoncferreira.github.io/home/bartuka/code/roam/notes/20240915190218-reference-missing/>cleaner</a> environment to be able to <strong>focus on the signals that my <a href=https://wandersoncferreira.github.io/home/bartuka/code/roam/notes/20240915190218-reference-missing/>body</a>
provides me</strong> at every step.</p>
<h2 id=on-improving-my-ability-to-focus>on improving my ability to focus</h2>
<p>i found funny that by <a href=https://wandersoncferreira.github.io/home/bartuka/code/roam/notes/20240915190218-reference-missing/>reading</a> this note i came into the conclusion that the
words i used to describe focus and its properties reminds me of <a href=/home/bartuka/code/roam/notes/20240622060436-meditation/>meditation</a>.</p>
<p>not to my surprise that many resources i have found thus far recommends
<a href=/home/bartuka/code/roam/notes/20240622060436-meditation/>meditation</a> as a way to improve our ability to control our attention.</p>
<p>luck for me that i have been doing meditation for the last 10 weeks and i
definitely see improvements on my daily behavior.</p>
<h2 id=on-the-matter-of-sustaining-focus>on the matter of sustaining focus</h2>
<p>i already noticed that keeping ourselves focused for a brief amount of time is
an arduous task. it is difficult to keep concentrated in a task of 1 or 2hrs of
duration. however, there are long term objectives that requires daily focus such
as keeping myself in the <a href=https://wandersoncferreira.github.io/home/bartuka/code/roam/notes/20240915190218-reference-missing/>diet</a> plan to reach my desired <a href=https://wandersoncferreira.github.io/home/bartuka/code/roam/notes/20240915190218-reference-missing/>body composition</a>
to <a href=https://wandersoncferreira.github.io/home/bartuka/code/roam/notes/20240915190218-reference-missing/>perform</a> the way i want in some event or circunstance.</p>
<p>therefore, for these situations it is important to rely on short term goals to
keep us in the correct track:</p>
<ol>
<li>weekly mileage
<ul>
<li><strong>Me at 2024-08-26</strong>: i want to eventually reach 80km per week in the future</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ol>

<ol>
<li>monthly mileage</li>
<li>more consistence with strength <a href=https://wandersoncferreira.github.io/home/bartuka/code/roam/notes/20240915190218-reference-missing/>training</a> and stretching</li>
</ol>
<p>i could explore this subject more by researching on the various types of <strong>focus</strong>
that we experience.</p>
