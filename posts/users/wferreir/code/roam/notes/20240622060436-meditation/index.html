<p>the word meditation has become more and more common in the content that i see
online. everyone wants a quieter <a href=https://wandersoncferreira.github.io/users/wferreir/code/roam/notes/20240915190218-reference-missing/>mind</a> so they can make better <a href=https://wandersoncferreira.github.io/users/wferreir/code/roam/notes/20240915190218-reference-missing/>decision</a>s, improve
<a href=/posts/users/wferreir/code/roam/notes/20240615110814-focus/>focus</a>, or continue some spiritual journey to find oneself.</p>
<p>i started this note to question whether i should try to meditate or not because
i feel the need to better handle my attention span. the amount of
<a href=https://wandersoncferreira.github.io/users/wferreir/code/roam/notes/20240915190218-reference-missing/>distractions</a> during the day is too difficult to handle alone without any
good training or preparation to protect me.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>meditation is not something you do
meditation is something entirely, a moviment into the whole question into our living
how we live, how we behave, whether we have fears, anxieties, sorrows, or if we
are pursuing pleasure, whether we have built images of ourselves and others.</p>
<p>this is part of our life and in the understanding of that life and of those
various issues involved in live and in being <a href=https://wandersoncferreira.github.io/users/wferreir/code/roam/notes/20240915190218-reference-missing/>free</a> from those.</p>
<p>Krishnamurti</p>

<p>my first encounter with meditation practice was through the book Zen Mind,
Beginner&rsquo;s Mind from Shunryu Suzuki. this book came in a very good time in my
<a href=https://wandersoncferreira.github.io/users/wferreir/code/roam/notes/20240915190218-reference-missing/>life</a>, i had quit my golden handcuff job, i was burned out from work, and i
had lost perspective on what i enjoy doing other than working.</p>
<p>before making the decision to start meditating, i had to clear some distinction
between meditation and buddhism. although, i enjoyed the <a href=https://wandersoncferreira.github.io/users/wferreir/code/roam/notes/20240915190218-reference-missing/>zen buddhism</a> when
i first read it, i am never comfortable following any religious group.
therefore, i made a shallow search on buddhism and ofc i didn&rsquo;t like that much
about what i saw there.</p>
<p>then, i was able to clearly place the meditative practice as something that is
solely done to better control my attention and be more connected with current
<a href=https://wandersoncferreira.github.io/users/wferreir/code/roam/notes/20240915190218-reference-missing/>reality</a>. if in the process of doing so, i end up more spiritual aligned as well,
i can call it a double win, right?</p>
<h2 id=why-should-i-medidate-and-what-is-the-significance-of-meditation>why should i medidate and what is the significance of meditation?</h2>
<p>there are many reasons that people find to start the <a href=https://wandersoncferreira.github.io/users/wferreir/code/roam/notes/20240915190218-reference-missing/>practice</a> of meditation such
as <a href=https://wandersoncferreira.github.io/users/wferreir/code/roam/notes/20240915190218-reference-missing/>enlightenment</a> which could be more related to a spiritual reason, peace
of mind, and better understanding of oneself.</p>
<p>i try to always question things, it is good to have <a href=https://wandersoncferreira.github.io/users/wferreir/code/roam/notes/20240915190218-reference-missing/>doubt</a>, to be <a href=https://wandersoncferreira.github.io/users/wferreir/code/roam/notes/20240915190218-reference-missing/>skeptical</a> up to
a certain point.</p>
<p>i researched some initial material to find out what is the meaning for
meditation, some definitions, and the context about this practice.</p>
<p>these quotes summarized some interesting points of view:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>when you say medidation you need to understand that this is not something you
can <strong>DO</strong> because you <strong>CAN</strong> become meditative, you CAN become meditation, but never
do it&mldr; it is a certain <strong>QUALITY</strong>.</p>
<p>medidation is something that blossom within you!</p>
<p>if you cultivate your <a href=https://wandersoncferreira.github.io/users/wferreir/code/roam/notes/20240915190218-reference-missing/>body</a>
if you cultivate your <a href=https://wandersoncferreira.github.io/users/wferreir/code/roam/notes/20240915190218-reference-missing/>mind</a>
if you cultivate your <a href=https://wandersoncferreira.github.io/users/wferreir/code/roam/notes/20240915190218-reference-missing/>emotion</a>
if you cultivate your <a href=https://wandersoncferreira.github.io/users/wferreir/code/roam/notes/20240915190218-reference-missing/>energy</a>
to a certain level of preparedness, then meditation will blossom within you.</p>

<p>the real purpose of meditation is to have fundamental <a href=https://wandersoncferreira.github.io/users/wferreir/code/roam/notes/20240915190218-reference-missing/>insights</a> into the nature
of your <a href=https://wandersoncferreira.github.io/users/wferreir/code/roam/notes/20240915190218-reference-missing/>mind</a> - insights that change your whole approach to <a href=https://wandersoncferreira.github.io/users/wferreir/code/roam/notes/20240915190218-reference-missing/>life</a></p>

<h3 id=don-t-medidate-because-it-s-good-for-you>don&rsquo;t medidate because it&rsquo;s good for you</h3>
<p>this is a small audio from Sam Haris on waking up about this. there are deeper
reasons to have an <a href=https://wandersoncferreira.github.io/users/wferreir/code/roam/notes/20240915190218-reference-missing/>examined life</a> other than &ldquo;doing it just because is good for
your health&rdquo;</p>
<p>free your attention from all the trivial things around us</p>
<h2 id=apps-about-meditation>apps about meditation</h2>
<p>i experimented a guided session with a random youtube video online and i found
it to be a lot easier for beginners. after that experience, i looked for apps
that offered this service.</p>
<ol>
<li>headspace
<ul>
<li>didn&rsquo;t like it ..</li>
<li>but it triggered a deeper search on which app should i try</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><a href=https://wandersoncferreira.github.io/users/wferreir/code/roam/notes/20240915190218-reference-missing/>waking up app</a>
<ul>
<li>i have been using this app a lot! its from Sam Harris and has a more
philosophical approach than the others i found.</li>
<li>each session takes from 8 to 15 minutes</li>
<li>there are lessons, practices, and interviews</li>
<li>for now, i recommend this app if you want to sit quietly</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ol>
<h2 id=types-of-meditation>types of meditation</h2>
