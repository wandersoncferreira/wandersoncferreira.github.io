We live in an ever changing environment, but the rate of change is high from either business or technology perspectives. I had the pleasure to work with smart business people and often felt their despair when they explained a new feature or a new pivoting in the product and the tech department went mad by thinking about how would they do that?</description></item><item><title>we dont know how to compute</title><link>https://wandersoncferreira.github.io/en/items/20220104151027-we_dont_know_how_to_compute/</link><pubDate>Tue, 04 Jan 2022 00:00:00 -0300</pubDate><guid>https://wandersoncferreira.github.io/en/items/20220104151027-we_dont_know_how_to_compute/</guid><description>These are some thoughts after watching We Really Don&amp;rsquo;t Know How to Compute! from Gerald Sussman.
Sussman is intrigued by how bad we build our systems today, basically when a problem to be solved changes we need to change the software too. Ideally we would add more code to deal with new requirements but often even a small change in the problem domain will represent a huge amount of code that needs to be shifted around.</description></item></channel></rss>
