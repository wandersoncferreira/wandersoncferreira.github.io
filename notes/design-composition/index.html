<p>Rich Hickey, Creator of Clojure</p>
<h2 id="thoughts">Thoughts</h2>
<p>I am currently working in a greenfield project and I will take some
step down and make sure I have all the pieces in place to move
forward. I&rsquo;ve being doing a lot of work to take things apart in this
project, but I need a big picture to address things like
comprehension, coordination, extension, reuse, testing, and
efficiency.</p>
<p>I have a profound simpathy for this talk because I often engaged in
discussions with colleagues about the situation of practice <em>before</em>
work in software development. I came from the geophysics industry and
before you touch any equipment or data, you have to be subjected to
tons of training and simulations. Why people learn to code in
production time? I think the problem is even worse because most
managers do not even know that this situation happens, they think that
the team is ready to solve anything. This is scary.</p>
