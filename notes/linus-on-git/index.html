<p>Linus Torvals</p>
<h2 id="thoughts">Thoughts</h2>
<p>It&rsquo;s interesting how clear the requirements about a SCM system should
have when Linus talks about it. One day I should experiment another
SCM tool, back at my days in the university we used none of these for
most of the time. Actually, I had to interact with several data files
that would be very nicely done inside a Database but I accessed it
directly from disk. Savages =)</p>
<p>Interesting to see how people at that audience is not familiar with
something that seems standard to me right now.</p>
<h2 id="quotes">Quotes</h2>
<p>The only security work that can be done is through network of trust,
and this should be the only way that development is done as well.</p>
<p>Distribution means, no one is special.</p>
<p>Git does not track files, it tracks your contents.</p>
<h2 id="recomendations">Recomendations</h2>
<ol>
<li>You might have as many branches as you like</li>
<li><em>Mercurial</em> has the same model as git and some differences to
implementation details</li>
<li>Centralized systems cannot work as well as distributed ones</li>
<li>Your functions should have names short, sweet and to the point</li>
<li>You should not have a single repository for every part of your
system. It&rsquo;s better to have a <em>super project</em> that have pointers to
other git repositories.</li>
<li>History must always be seens on a project basis</li>
</ol>
