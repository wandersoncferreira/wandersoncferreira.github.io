express any thought. Therefore, everytime I read any Kant essay I need to be
extra diligent with words that I take for granted. This one caught me by
surprise because all of sudden the essay stopped making sense to me. What does
he meant with &ldquo;public?&rdquo;</p><p>Let&rsquo;s find out! The internet for the rescue. Luckily we have a lot of literature
about everything nowdays. I&rsquo;m relying on this <a href=/pdfs/laursen1986.pdf>paper</a> to make sense of things.</p><blockquote><p>[&mldr;] The key to his message is his stand on the meaning of the terms &ldquo;public&rdquo;
and &ldquo;private&rdquo;. The private use of reason &ldquo;is that which a person may make of it
in a particular civil post or office with which he is entrusted&rdquo;, he writes. In
contrast, the public use of reason is a matter of writing and publishing. Kant
explains: &ldquo;by the public use of one&rsquo;s reason I mean that use which anyone may
make of it as a scholar addressing the entire reading public&rdquo;.</p></blockquote><p>Seems like he inverted the meaning of public vs private. But why? Seems like a
meaning restriction campaign was held along the years where the term &ldquo;public&rdquo;
became associated with &ldquo;pertaining to the state&rdquo;.</p></div></article></main><aside><div><div><h3>LATEST POSTS</h3></div><div><ul><li><a href=/bookmarks/the_other_kind_of_staff_software_engineer/>the other kind of staff software engineer</a></li><li><a href=/notes/how_can_i_achieve_programming_mastery/>how can I achieve programming mastery?</a></li><li><a href=/notes/ability_to_acquire_knowledge/>ability to acquire knowledge</a></li><li><a href=/notes/ability_to_solve_problems/>ability to solve problems</a></li><li><a href=/notes/thought_leaders/>thought-leaders</a></li></ul></div></div></aside><div id=disqus_thread></div><script type=application/javascript>window.disqus_config=function(){},function(){if(["localhost","127.0.0.1"].indexOf(window.location.hostname)!=-1){document.getElementById("disqus_thread").innerHTML="Disqus comments not available by default when the website is previewed locally.";return}var t=document,e=t.createElement("script");e.async=!0,e.src="//bartuka.disqus.com/embed.js",e.setAttribute("data-timestamp",+new Date),(t.head||t.body).appendChild(e)}()</script><noscript>Please enable JavaScript to view the <a href=https://disqus.com/?ref_noscript>comments powered by Disqus.</a></noscript><a href=https://disqus.com class=dsq-brlink>comments powered by <span class=logo-disqus>Disqus</span></a><footer><p>&copy; 2022 <a href=https://wandersoncferreira.github.io><b>Wanderson Ferreira</b></a>.
