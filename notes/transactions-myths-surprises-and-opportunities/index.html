<h2 id="speaker">Speaker</h2>
<p>Martin Kleppmann</p>
<h2 id="thoughts">Thoughts</h2>
<p>This was the first talk from Martin that I saw, he is very thoughtful
and explains complex ideas somehow easily. I think because of Datomic
I got more interest in databases, I did the Day of Datomic course in
person at Cognitect and it was very nice to meet so many people
interested in databases.</p>
<p>Looks like the software engineers in general does not like this
subject very much, however seems like the job of building and dealing
with &ldquo;information systems&rdquo; will require you to know more and more
about these tools.</p>
<p>I will keep watching materials from Martin now. Luckily, I already had
his book. Looking forward to read it.</p>
<h2 id="quotes">Quotes</h2>
<p>Durability:</p>
<ul>
<li>archive tape</li>
<li>fysnc to disk</li>
<li>replication</li>
</ul>
<p>Consistency:</p>
<ul>
<li>Not related to C in CAP theorem</li>
<li>&ldquo;tossed in to make the acronym work&rdquo; (? lol)</li>
<li>property of how the application use the database not the database itself</li>
</ul>
<p>Atomicity:</p>
<ul>
<li>not about concurrency!</li>
<li>handling faults (crashes)</li>
<li>transactions = (multi-object) atomicity, rollback writes on abort</li>
<li>Abortability is better name rather than Atomicity</li>
</ul>
<p>Isolation:</p>
<ul>
<li>Serializable?</li>
<li>Read committed. You read only after the operation has been committed.</li>
<li>Snapshot isolation. Try to prevent read skew</li>
<li>Repeatable read. Try to prevent read skew</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="recommendations">Recommendations</h2>
<ol>
<li>Create transaction boundaries in your applications.</li>
<li>Avoid transactions across services</li>
<li>Learn the isolation levels defaults of your database and the implications</li>
</ol>
