<h2 id="speaker">Speaker</h2>
<p>David Hansson, Martin Fowler and Kent Beck</p>
<h2 id="thoughts">Thoughts</h2>
<p>Yes, this debate was good to listen. Kent Beck itself really talking
about how the thing came to be. TDD is very nice for some workflows,
but the path to fast feedback loop is alwaaayyss desireble. That is
the main reason I see some people in the Clojure community advocating
about REPL-driven development instead of TDD.</p>
<p>You can have immediate feedback of your running system! This the
supreme case for fast feedback loops.</p>
<p>However, there are also some people that speak with the sole, unique
truth by their side. You should use TDD or you are <em>NOT</em> a
professional.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve seen talks from Uncle Bob saying something like that. Really?
That defines me? I&rsquo;ve been trying really hard to understand how can a
testable code provide a better design architecture only by being
testable.</p>
<p>In my point of view, it looks like one more subject that programmers
like to debate to run away from the real problems. TDD you can
control, is under your choices. But there are complex stuff happening
at the business domain level, techinical requirements like distributed
systems, concurrency, auditable, and many others that are way more
complicated to define.</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s agree that the definitions of professionalism in software
development is way far from being defined. It&rsquo;s a hacky community and
I really like that way.</p>
<h2 id="quotes">Quotes</h2>
<p>TDD helps you with anxiety in programming craft</p>
<p>I feel it is very hard to write test first before I see the code</p>
<p>We should always think about how can we tweak the design to the code
be testable</p>
<p>The isolation of unit testing is not mandatory inside the idea of TDD</p>
<p>Fallacy: Because your code is more testable, it has a better design</p>
<h2 id="recomendations">Recomendations</h2>
<ol>
<li>Can we be confident about your work? We should.</li>
<li>Some parts of the project you can use TDD and some others you simply can&rsquo;t</li>
<li>Kent works from specific to general and TDD is good in this way</li>
<li>I barely mock stuff</li>
<li>Have self-testing code is critical. Have a command that can test
your entire system</li>
</ol>
