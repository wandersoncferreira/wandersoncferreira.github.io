Searching for **patience** in different contexts I found a good definition from
psychology professor that believes that patience is situational form of emotion
regulation, quote:

> When we feel the emotion of impatience, patience is the name of the
> self-regulation tools we apply to cope with that feeling. Whether that's
> self-talk, deep breaths, or preemption, those subtle or explicit self-control
> strategies in the face of uncertain, stressful waiting are acts of patience.

> Kate Sweeny

I liked the definition from Kate Sweeny because it states that patience is the
application of [patience strategies]({{< relref "20250102151130-patience_strategies.md" >}}) to handle an emotion that bothers us at that
time. This is good news because it means I only need to know which are the
available strategies out there and which ones will actually work for me.

This answer from a Reddit user is very good as well:

a good way that i have found to improve that rushed part of me is to remind
myself [time will pass anyways]({{< relref "20240712190847-time_will_pass_anyways.md" >}}).

-   **Me:** i have personally done this **MULTIPLE** times and it is weird that this
    really helped me. sometimes i even think to myself all the things i will be
    doing **AFTER** the event i am anxious about. it's like reminding myself
    that there is [life]({{< relref "20240612233042-life.md" >}}) afterwards.

Q: for people who have great patience what's your secret?
A: understanding. I always assume there's a reason for someone being late or
behaving a certain way and that maybe that person just hasn't learned any better
yet. so i try to understand what's happening so that i can better understand
what's going on and empathize
