i'm starting to understand the idea of sport psychology, seems like a variety of
techniques to help an athlete to handle mental challenges.

this idea of [mental training]({{< relref "20240614214810-mental_training.md" >}}) is fascinating, specially when you are young and **you
think** that you have all the pressure of the world on your shoulders.

nice that I know more about this now, who knows if anyone from my [family]({{< relref "20240614202117-family.md" >}}) will
ever need this kind of support.

for now, I am struggling with the process to become a [marathonist]({{< relref "20240614220648-marathonist.md" >}}), at least i
have identified some of the main pain points that i am facing:

1.  [diet]({{< relref "20240614220717-diet.md" >}}) and [nutrition]({{< relref "20240711214205-nutrition.md" >}}) in general
2.  [hidration]({{< relref "20240614220732-hidration.md" >}})
3.  [patience]({{< relref "20240614220742-patience.md" >}})
