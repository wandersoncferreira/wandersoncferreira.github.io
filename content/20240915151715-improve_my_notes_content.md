{{< figure src="/img/notes.jpg" caption="<span class=\"figure-number\">Figure 1: </span>Seems to be the mood I turn myself when I decide to write a note. Made by Jack B Yeats, Irish, 1871-1957." >}}

i've been thinking if the way i am currently writting my notes could be
significantly improved with little effort. my main object is to be able to
continue to collect thought in a way that does not require much structure and
formalism however i am also aware that many tools in the future could be used to
parse and extract useful [information]({{< relref "20240830173307-information.md" >}}) from these notes.

i want to spend a few hours searching for what is well established on this field
that could lead me to write better with few or no impediments added to my
current workflow.

there are a few ways to take notes:

1.  mind-mapping
2.  cornell note-taking
3.  outlining
4.  sentence method

there is also another perspective into the note system, i should go back to my
notes and reflect on it.

recently i decided to start my notes with a unoficial "definition" of the
concept of the note in the first paragraph. this has been interesting as it
cascades a good flow of reading for the note. i noticed that most of my notes
"started from nowhere". if you open it, the tone of the text indicates that you
end up in the middle of something but you don't know what it is.


## reflecting on your notes {#reflecting-on-your-notes}

reflecting on the notes is as important as taking the notes themselves. i should
give myself time to read over and think about how this information impacts me.

some questions to reflect on when reviewing the notes:

1.  why did i seek out the information in the first place?
2.  did it spark something in me that i had never thought about before?
3.  can i use this as a journaling prompt to get more ideas?
4.  is this something i can put into [practice]({{< relref "20240622061935-practice.md" >}}) as a hobby or [habits]({{< relref "20240721142704-habits.md" >}})?

the best option would be to **interpret** and not transcribe things into the note
taking system, however it is very difficult to do this simultaneously as we
listen/read the content we are interested about. therefore, revisiting the notes
is definitely critical to improve the quality of the notes over time.


## outlining method for note-taking {#outlining-method-for-note-taking}

this is the most common form of note-taking and it is the way i have been doing
so far in most of my notes around here.
i like this approach of structuring the ideas into a form of hierarchical tree
that help me see relationships between each bullet point.


## sentence method for note-taking {#sentence-method-for-note-taking}

the sentence method involves recording the notes as complete sentences. with
each new idea or concept, begin a new line with a new sentence.
