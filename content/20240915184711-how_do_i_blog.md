This is a meta post in order to teach myself from the future how to do it!

I often spend a few weeks without the desire to write anything in my blog (~~I
should fix that but let's be real first~~), but at some moment I do want to type
some letters down.. but they I freeze.. how do I do it?

These are the steps I used to write this blog post starting from complete scratch:

1.  I use hugo.
2.  These are the relevant commands run using Hugo
    ```sh
    hugo new site wandersoncferreira
    hugo new posts/first.md
    cd themes/
    git submodule add git@github.com:wandersoncferreira/hugo-theme-nostyleplease.git
    ```

3.  I use Emacs
4.  My Emacs has a `ox-hugo` plugin enabled
5.  These are the relevant lines to configure `ox-hugo` properly
    ```elisp
    (after! ox-hugo
      (setq org-hugo-base-dir "~/code/wandersoncferreira.github.io"
            org-hugo-section "posts"))
    ```

6.  I wrote an `org` file inside the `orgfiles` folder
7.  I had to add some special meta information in the header of the file:
    1.  `#+title:`
    2.  `#+date:` created using `M-x org-time-stamp`
    3.  `#+draft:` true or false
    4.  [OPTIONAL] `#+author:`
    5.  [OPTIONAL] `#+filetags:`
        1.  are you wondering why `filetags` and not only `tags`? The [answer](https://ox-hugo.scripter.co/doc/tags-and-categories/#why-use-plus-filetags-and-not-plus-tags) is waiting for you
8.  Time to publish
    1.  `spc m e` to run `org-export-dispatch`
    2.  `H` to export to `ox-hugo`
    3.  commit all the files

A clever github action will handle everything from here onwards!
