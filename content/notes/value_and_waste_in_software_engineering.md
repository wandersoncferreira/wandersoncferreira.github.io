-   what is waste?
    -   bad code reviews
    -   building the wrong feature or product
    -   mismanaging the backlog
    -   rework
    -   unecessarily complex solutions
    -   extraneous cognitive load
    -   psychological distress
    -   knowledge loss
    -   waiting
    -   ineffective communication

-   human values?
    -   maintain honour + respect for users
        -   e.g. what user information is kept, how is it shared?
    -   facilitate different origins, languages, cultures, knowledge
