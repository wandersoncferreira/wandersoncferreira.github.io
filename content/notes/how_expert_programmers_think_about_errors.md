Link of the [talk](https://youtu.be/Jor-Rh0gwus).

-   pay attention to what is hidden
-   attending to contrary evidence
-   seek falsification
-   write comments about what is not in the code: intentions and assumptions
-   understanding by breaking
-   re-assessing the landscape and deliberately expanding the search space
-   sometimes a high performance team avoids using methodologies
-   playing methods against each other
    -   building errors into the code to verify the test suite etc
-   the interplay between developers is crucial
-   experts use disciplined practices that are socially embedded and reinforced
-   contrasting multiple perspectives
    -   fixes the problem and not worries about the **blame**
