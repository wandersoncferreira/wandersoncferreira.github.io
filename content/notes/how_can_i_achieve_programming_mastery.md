Rich Hickey once said: Mastery comes from a combination of at least several of the following:

-   Knowledge
-   Focus
-   Relentless considered practice over a long period of time
-   Detected, recovered-from failures
-   Mentorship by an expert
-   Always working slightly beyond your comfort/ability zone, pushing it ever forward

What skills then are so universally useful and transportable in software development? Two are:

-   [ability to acquire knowledge]({{< relref "ability_to_acquire_knowledge.md" >}})
-   [ability to solve problems]({{< relref "ability_to_solve_problems.md" >}})

Rich seems to believe that one can get better at acquiring knowledge and solving
problems by acquiring ever deeper knowledge and solving ever harder problems. Is
that it? Can we provide clearer pathways to such goals?
