someone has a single solution that seems to fit every problem.

In this [post](https://earthly.dev/blog/thought-leaders/), Adam Gordon Bell discuss the advices given by thought-leaders. In
his research he found the work of [Philip E. Tetlock](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=CJjf6H0AAAAJ&hl=en) on the decision-making
process of experts. Tetlock was able to split the group of experts in his
research broadly in two groups: the hedgehogs and foxes.

-   hedgehog
    -   has one big idea like "free-market capitalism" which they use as a lens to look at many issues
    -   they are "confident forecasters"
-   foxes
    -   they have complicated advice and were skeptical of even their own predictions
    -   less likely to be famous because their advices are harder to explain in a sound bite

When all predictions were added up and scores, hedgehogs lost out to foxes.
