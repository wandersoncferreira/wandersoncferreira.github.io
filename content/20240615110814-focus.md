focus is the ability to carefully pay attention to something such as a task or a
person. it requires a lot of [concentration]({{< relref "20240615110808-concentration.md" >}}).

> the ability to control our attention

in the world of [sport psycology]({{< relref "20240614214250-sport_psychologist.md" >}}), focus is a critical skill that must
be mastered by all athletes that desire to exceed in their role. for my
particular scenario at [running]({{< relref "20240628153132-running.md" >}}), there are some key moments that i really need to
focus on the task at hand:

1.  [race]({{< relref "20240619104543-race.md" >}})s
2.  the [long run]({{< relref "20240711215736-long_run.md" >}})
3.  regular workouts such as sprints

it is very important to keep myself concentrated and [present]({{< relref "20240622054653-present.md" >}}) in the moment
when i am realizing these activities. therefore, i do not listen to music,
podcasts, etc. i try to minimize all [distractions]({{< relref "20240622054034-distractions.md" >}}) that i can [control]({{< relref "20240712185744-control.md" >}}) to build
this [cleaner]({{< relref "20240717160403-cleaner.md" >}}) environment to be able to **focus on the signals that my [body]({{< relref "20240720094206-body.md" >}})
provides me** at every step.


## on improving my ability to focus {#on-improving-my-ability-to-focus}

i found funny that by [reading]({{< relref "20240615180351-reading.md" >}}) this note i came into the conclusion that the
words i used to describe focus and its properties reminds me of [meditation]({{< relref "20240622060436-meditation.md" >}}).

not to my surprise that many resources i have found thus far recommends
[meditation]({{< relref "20240622060436-meditation.md" >}}) as a way to improve our ability to control our attention.

luck for me that i have been doing meditation for the last 10 weeks and i
definitely see improvements on my daily behavior.


## on the matter of sustaining focus {#on-the-matter-of-sustaining-focus}

i already noticed that keeping ourselves focused for a brief amount of time is
an arduous task. it is difficult to keep concentrated in a task of 1 or 2hrs of
duration. however, there are long term objectives that requires daily focus such
as keeping myself in the [diet]({{< relref "20240614220717-diet.md" >}}) plan to reach my desired [body composition]({{< relref "20240915160606-body_composition.md" >}})
to [perform]({{< relref "20240615104929-performance.md" >}}) the way i want in some event or circunstance.

therefore, for these situations it is important to rely on short term goals to
keep us in the correct track:

1.  weekly mileage
    -   **Me at 2024-08-26**: i want to eventually reach 80km per week in the future

        {{< figure src="/img/weekly_mileage.png" >}}

2.  monthly mileage
3.  more consistence with strength [training]({{< relref "20240615170107-training.md" >}}) and stretching

i could explore this subject more by researching on the various types of **focus**
that we experience.
