<a href=/tags/raw-page>raw-page</a><div><p>It&rsquo;s common to see people advocate for learning skills that they have or
using processes that they use. For example, Steve Yegge has a set of
blog posts where he recommends reading compiler books and learning about
compilers. His reasoning is basically that, if you understand compilers,
you&rsquo;ll see compiler problems everywhere and will recognize all of the
cases where people are solving a compiler problem without using compiler
knowledge. Instead of hacking together some half-baked solution that
will never work, you can apply a bit of computer science knowledge to
solve the problem in a better way with less effort. That&rsquo;s not untrue,
but it&rsquo;s also not a reason to study compilers in particular because you
can say that about many different areas of computer science and math.
Queuing theory, computer architecture, mathematical optimization,
operations research, etc.</p><p>One response to that kind of objection is to say that
<a href=https://twitter.com/danluu/status/899141882760110081>one should study
everything</a>. While being an extremely broad generalist can work, it&rsquo;s
gotten much harder to &ldquo;know a bit of everything&rdquo; and be effective
because there&rsquo;s more of everything over time (in terms of both breadth
and depth). And even if that weren&rsquo;t the case, I think saying “should”
is too strong; whether or not someone enjoys having that kind of breadth
is a matter of taste. Another approach that can also work, one that&rsquo;s
more to my taste, is to,
<a href=https://alumni.media.mit.edu/~cahn/life/gian-carlo-rota-10-lessons.html>as
Gian Carlo Rota put it</a>, learn a few tricks:</p><blockquote><p>A long time ago an older and well known number theorist made some
disparaging remarks about Paul Erdos&rsquo; work. You admire contributions to
mathematics as much as I do, and I felt annoyed when the older
mathematician flatly and definitively stated that all of Erdos&rsquo; work
could be reduced to a few tricks which Erdos repeatedly relied on in his
proofs. What the number theorist did not realize is that other
mathematicians, even the very best, also rely on a few tricks which they
use over and over. Take Hilbert. The second volume of Hilbert&rsquo;s
collected papers contains Hilbert&rsquo;s papers in invariant theory. I have
made a point of reading some of these papers with care. It is sad to
note that some of Hilbert&rsquo;s beautiful results have been completely
forgotten. But on reading the proofs of Hilbert&rsquo;s striking and deep
theorems in invariant theory, it was surprising to verify that Hilbert&rsquo;s
proofs relied on the same few tricks. Even Hilbert had only a few
tricks!</p></blockquote><p>If you look at how people succeed in various fields, you&rsquo;ll see that
this is a common approach. For example,
<a href=https://judoinfo.com/weers1/>this analysis of world-class judo
players found that most rely on a small handful of throws</a>,
concluding^1</p><blockquote><p>Judo is a game of specialization. You have to use the skills that work
best for you. You have to stick to what works and practice your skills
until they become automatic responses.</p></blockquote><p>If you watch an anime or a TV series &ldquo;about&rdquo; fighting, people often
improve by increasing the number of techniques they know because that&rsquo;s
an easy thing to depict but, in real life, getting better at techniques
you already know is often more effective than having a portfolio of
hundreds of &ldquo;moves&rdquo;.</p><p><a href=https://staffeng.com/stories/joy-ebertz>Relatedly, Joy Ebertz says</a>:</p><blockquote><p>One piece of advice I got at some point was to amplify my strengths. All
of us have strengths and weaknesses and we spend a lot of time talking
about ‘areas of improvement.&rsquo; It can be easy to feel like the best way
to advance is to eliminate all of those. However, it can require a lot
of work and energy to barely move the needle if it&rsquo;s truly an area we&rsquo;re
weak in. Obviously, you still want to make sure you don&rsquo;t have any truly
bad areas, but assuming you&rsquo;ve gotten that, instead focus on amplifying
your strengths. How can you turn something you&rsquo;re good at into your
superpower?</p></blockquote><p>I&rsquo;ve personally found this to be true in a variety of disciplines. While
it&rsquo;s really difficult to measure programmer effectiveness in anything
resembling an objective manner, this isn&rsquo;t true of some things I&rsquo;ve
done, like competitive video games (a very long time ago at this point,
back before there was &ldquo;real&rdquo; money in competitive gaming), the thing
that took me from being a pretty decent player to a
<a href=/look-stupid/#fn:B>very good player</a> was abandoning practicing
things I wasn&rsquo;t particularly good at and focusing on increasing the edge
I had over everybody else at the few things I was unusually good at.</p><p>This can work for games and sports because you can get better
maneuvering yourself into positions that take advantage of your
strengths as well as avoiding situations that expose your weaknesses. I
think this is actually more effective at work than it is in sports or
gaming since, unlike in competitive endeavors, you don&rsquo;t have an
opponent who will try to expose your weaknesses and force you into
positions where your strengths are irrelevant. If I study queuing theory
instead of compilers, a rival co-worker isn&rsquo;t going to stop me from
working on projects where queuing theory knowledge is helpful and leave
me facing a field full of projects that require compiler knowledge.</p><p>One thing that&rsquo;s worth noting is that skills don&rsquo;t have to be things
people would consider fields of study or discrete techniques. For the
past three years, the main skill I&rsquo;ve been applying and improving is
something you might call &ldquo;looking at data&rdquo;; the term is in quotes
because I don&rsquo;t know of a good term for it. I don&rsquo;t think it&rsquo;s what most
people would think of as &ldquo;statistics&rdquo;, in that I don&rsquo;t often need to do
anything as sophisticated as logistic regression, let alone actually
sophisticated. Perhaps one could argue that this is something data
scientists do, but if I look at what I do vs. what data scientists we
hire do as well as what we screen for in data scientist interviews, we
don&rsquo;t appear to want to hire data scientists with the skill I&rsquo;ve been
working on nor do they do what I&rsquo;m doing (this is a long enough topic
that I might turn it into its own post at some point).</p><p>Unlike Matt Might or Steve Yegge, I&rsquo;m not going to say that you should
take a particular approach, but I&rsquo;ll say that working on a few things
and not being particularly well rounded has worked for me in multiple
disparate fields and it appears to work for a lot of other folks as
well.</p><p>If you want to take this approach, this still leaves the question of
what skills to learn. This is one of the most common questions I get
asked and I think my answer is probably not really what people are
looking for and not very satisfying since it&rsquo;s both
<a href=https://twitter.com/danluu/status/1428445465662603272>obvious and
difficult to put into practice</a>.</p><p>For me, two ingredients for figuring out what to spend time learning are
having a relative aptitude for something (relative to other things I
might do, not relative to other people) and also having a good
environment in which to learn. To say that someone should look for those
things is so vague that&rsquo;s it&rsquo;s nearly useless, but it&rsquo;s still better
than the usual advice, which boils down to &ldquo;learn what I learned&rdquo;, which
results in advice like &ldquo;Career pro tip: if you want to get good, REALLY
good, at designing complex and stateful distributed systems at scale in
real-world environments, learn functional programming. It is an almost
perfectly identical skillset.&rdquo; or the even more extreme claims from some
language communities, like Chuck Moore&rsquo;s claim that Forth is
<a href=/boring-languages/>at least 100x as productive as boring languages</a>.</p><p>I took generic internet advice early in my career, including language
advice (this was when much of this kind of advice was relatively young
and it was not yet possible to easily observe that, despite many people
taking advice like this, people who took this kind of advice were not
particularly effective and people who are particularly effective were
not likely to have taken this kind of advice). I learned
<a href=https://twitter.com/sc13ts/status/1448003352655060997>Haskell, Lisp,
Forth</a>,
<a href=https://malisper.me/there-is-more-to-programming-than-programming-languages/>etc</a>.
At one point in my career, I was on a two person team that implemented
what might still be, a decade later, the highest performance Forth
processor in existence (it was a 2GHz IPC-oriented processor) and I
programmed it as well (there were good reasons for this to be a stack
processor, so Forth seemed like as good a choice as any).
<a href=https://yosefk.com/blog/my-history-with-forth-stack-machines.html>Like
Yossi Kreinin, I think I can say that I spent more effort than most
people have becoming proficient in Forth, and like him, not only did I
not find it find it to be a 100x productivity tool, it wasn&rsquo;t clear that
it would, in general, even be 1x on productivity</a>. To be fair, a number
of other tools did better than 1x on productivity but, overall, I think
following internet advice was very low ROI and the things that I learned
that were high ROI weren&rsquo;t things people were recommending.</p><p>In retrospect, when people said things like &ldquo;Forth is very productive&rdquo;,
what I suspect they really meant was &ldquo;Forth makes me very productive and
I have not considered how well this generalizes to people with different
aptitudes or who are operating in different contexts&rdquo;. I find it totally
plausible that Forth (or Lisp or Haskell or any other tool or technique)
does work very well for some particular people, but I think that people
tend to overestimate how much something working for them means that it
works for other people,
<a href=https://twitter.com/danluu/status/1355661542155378688>making advice
generally useless because it doesn&rsquo;t distinguish between advice that&rsquo;s
aptitude or circumstance specific and generalizable advice, which is in
stark contrast to fields where people actually discuss the pros and cons
of particular techniques</a>^2</p><p>While a coach can give you advice that&rsquo;s tailored to you 1 on 1 or in
small groups, that&rsquo;s difficult to do on the internet, which is why the
best I can do here is the uselessly vague &ldquo;pick up skills that are
suitable for you&rdquo;. Just for example, two skills that clicked for me are
&ldquo;having an adversarial mindset&rdquo; and &ldquo;looking at data&rdquo;. A perhaps less
useless piece of advice is that, if you&rsquo;re having a hard time
identifying what those might be, you can ask people who know you very
well, e.g., my manager and Ben Kuhn independently named coming up with
solutions that span many levels of abstraction as a skill of mine that I
frequently apply (and I didn&rsquo;t realize I was doing that until they
pointed it out).</p><p>Another way to find these is to look for things you can&rsquo;t help but do
that most other people don&rsquo;t seem to do, which is true for me of both
&ldquo;looking at data&rdquo; and &ldquo;having an adversarial mindset&rdquo;. Just for example,
on having an adversarial mindset, when a company I was working for was
beta testing a new custom bug tracker, I filed some of the first bugs on
it and put unusual things into the fields to see if it would break. Some
people really didn&rsquo;t understand why anyone would do such a thing and
were baffled, disgusted, or horrified, but a few people (including the
authors, who I knew wouldn&rsquo;t mind), really got it and were happy to see
the system pushed past its limits. Poking at the limits of a system to
see where it falls apart doesn&rsquo;t feel like work to me; it&rsquo;s something
that I&rsquo;d have to stop myself from doing if I wanted to not do it, which
made spending a decade getting better at testing and verification
techniques felt like something hard not to do and not work. Looking
deeply into data is one I&rsquo;ve spent more than a decade on at this point
and it&rsquo;s another one that, to me, emotionally feels almost wrong to not
improve at.</p><p>That these things are suited to me is basically due to my personality,
and not something inherent about human beings. Other people are going to
have different things that really feel easy/right for them, which is
great, since if everyone was into looking at data and no one was into
building things, that would be very problematic (although, IMO, looking
at data is, on average, underrated).</p><p>The other major ingredient in what I&rsquo;ve tried to learn is finding
environments that are conducive to learning things that line up with my
skills that make sense for me. Although suggesting that other people do
the same sounds like advice that&rsquo;s so obvious that it&rsquo;s useless, based
on how I&rsquo;ve seen people select what team and company to work on, I think
that almost nobody does this and, as a result, discussing this may not
be completely useless.</p><p>An example of not doing this which typifies what I usually see is a case
I just happened to find out about because I chatted with a manager about
why their team had lost their new full-time intern conversion employee.
I asked them about it since it was unusual for that manager to lose
anyone since they&rsquo;re very good at retaining people and have low turnover
on their teams. It turned out that their intern had wanted to work on
infra, but had joined this manager&rsquo;s product team because they didn&rsquo;t
know that they could ask to be on a team that matched their preferences.
After the manager found out, the manager wanted the intern to be happy
and facilitated a transfer to an infra team. In this case, this was a
double whammy since the new hire doubly didn&rsquo;t consider working in an
environment conducive for learning the skills they wanted. They made no
attempt to work in the area they were interested in and then they joined
a company that has a dysfunctional infra org that generally has poor
design and operational practices, making the company a relatively
difficult place to learn about infra on top of not even trying to land
on an infra team. While that&rsquo;s an unusually bad example, in the median
case that I&rsquo;ve seen, people don&rsquo;t make decisions that result in
particularly good outcomes with respect to learning even though good
opportunities to learn are one of the top things people say that they
want.</p><p>For example, Steve Yegge has noted:</p><blockquote><p>The most frequently-asked question from college candidates is: &ldquo;what
kind of training and/or mentoring do you offer?&rdquo; &mldr; One UW interviewee
just told me about Ford Motor Company&rsquo;s mentoring program, which Ford
had apparently used as part of the sales pitch they do for interviewees.
[I&rsquo;ve elided the details, as they weren&rsquo;t really relevant. -stevey
3/1/2006] The student had absorbed it all in amazing detail. That
doesn&rsquo;t really surprise me, because it&rsquo;s one of the things candidates
care about most.</p></blockquote><p>For myself, I was lucky that my first job, Centaur, was a great place to
develop having an adversarial mindset with respect to testing and
verification. When I compare what the verification team there
accomplished, it&rsquo;s comparable to peer projects at other companies that
employed much larger teams to do very similar things with similar or
worse effectiveness, implying that the team was highly productive, which
made that a really good place to learn.</p><p>Moreover, I don&rsquo;t think I could&rsquo;ve learned as quickly on my own or by
trying to follow advice from books or the internet. I think that
<a href=/hardware-unforgiving/>people who are really good at something have
too many bits of information in their head about how to do it for that
information to really be compressible into a book, let alone a blog
post</a>. In sports, good coaches are able to convey that kind of
information over time, but I don&rsquo;t know of anything similar for
programming, so I think the best thing available for learning rate is to
find an environment that&rsquo;s full of experts^3</p><p>For &ldquo;looking at data&rdquo;, while I got a lot better at it from working on
that skill in environments where people weren&rsquo;t really taking data
seriously, the rate of improvement during the past few years, where I&rsquo;m
in an environment where I can toss ideas back and forth with people who
are very good at understanding the limitations of what data can tell you
as well as good at informing data analysis with deep domain knowledge,
has been much higher. I&rsquo;d say that I improved more at this in each
individual year at my current job than I did in the decade prior to my
current job.</p><p>One thing to perhaps note is that the environment, how you spend your
day-to-day, is inherently local. My current employer is probably the
least data driven of the three large tech companies I&rsquo;ve worked for, but
my vicinity is a great place to get better at looking at data because I
spend a relatively large fraction of my time working with people who are
great with data, like Rebecca Isaacs, and a relatively small fraction of
the time working with people who don&rsquo;t take data seriously.</p><p>This post has discussed some strategies with an eye towards why they can
be valuable, but I have to admit that my motivation for learning from
experts wasn&rsquo;t to create value. It&rsquo;s more that I find learning to be fun
and there are some areas where I&rsquo;m motivated enough to apply the skills
regardless of the environment, and learning from experts is such a great
opportunity to have fun that it&rsquo;s hard to resist. Doing this for a
couple of decades has turned out to be useful, but that&rsquo;s not something
I knew would happen for quite a while (and I had no idea that this would
effectively transfer to a new industry until I changed from hardware to
software).</p><p>A lot of career advice I see is oriented towards career or success or
growth. That kind of advice often tells people to have a long-term goal
or strategy in mind. It will often have some argument that&rsquo;s along the
lines of &ldquo;a random walk will only move you sqrt(n) in some direction
whereas a directed walk will move you n in some direction&rdquo;. I don&rsquo;t
think that&rsquo;s wrong, but I think that, for many people, that advice
implicitly underestimates the difficulty of finding an area that&rsquo;s
suited to you^4, which I&rsquo;ve basically
<a href=https://twitter.com/jeanqasaur/status/1074528356324892672>done by
trial and error</a>.</p><h2 id=appendix-parts-of-the-problem-this-post-doesn-t-discuss-in-detail>Appendix: parts of the problem this post doesn&rsquo;t discuss in detail</h2><p>One major topic not discussed is how to balance what &ldquo;level&rdquo; of skill to
work on, which could be something high level, like &ldquo;looking at data&rdquo;, to
something lower level, like &ldquo;Bayesian multilevel models&rdquo;, to something
even lower level, like &ldquo;typing speed&rdquo;. That&rsquo;s a large enough topic that
it deserves its own post that I&rsquo;d expect to be longer than this one but,
for now,
<a href=/productivity-velocity/#appendix-one-way-to-think-about-what-to-improve>here&rsquo;s
a comment from Gary Bernhardt about something related that I believe
also applies to this topic</a>.</p><p>Another major topic that&rsquo;s not discussed here is picking skills that are
relatively likely to be applicable. It&rsquo;s a little too naive to just say
that someone should think about learning skills they have an aptitude
for without thinking about applicability.</p><p>But while it&rsquo;s pretty easy to pick out skills where it&rsquo;s very difficult
to either have an impact on the world or make a decent amount of money
or achieve whatever goal you might want to achieve, like &ldquo;basketball&rdquo; or
&ldquo;boxing&rdquo;, it&rsquo;s harder to pick between plausible skills, like computer
architecture vs. PL.</p><p>But I think semi-reasonable sounding skills are likely enough to be high
return if they&rsquo;re a good fit for someone that trial and error among
semi-reasonable sounding skills is fine, although it probably helps
<a href=/productivity-velocity/>to be able to try things out quickly</a></p><h2 id=appendix-related-posts>Appendix: related posts</h2><ul><li>Ben Kuhn on, in some sense,

different mix of throws, but it&rsquo;s still the case that you see
specialists having a lot of success, e.g., Riner with osoto gari</p></li><li><p>To be fair to blanket, context free, advice, to learn a particular
topic, functional programming really clicked for me and I could
imagine that, if that style of thinking wasn&rsquo;t already natural for me
(as a result of coming from a hardware background), the advice that
one should learn functional programming because it will change how
you think about problems might&rsquo;ve been useful for me, but on the
other hand, that means that the advice could&rsquo;ve just as easily been
to learn hardware engineering.</p></li><li><p>I don&rsquo;t have a large enough sample nor have I polled enough people to
have high confidence that this works as a general algorithm but, for
finding groups of world-class experts, what&rsquo;s worked for me is
finding excellent managers. The two teams I worked on with the
highest density of world-class experts have been teams under really
great management. I have a higher bar for excellent management than
most people and, from having talked to many people about this, almost
no one I&rsquo;ve talked to has worked for or even knows a manager as good
as one I would consider to be excellent (and, general, both the
person I&rsquo;m talking to agrees with me on this, indicating that it&rsquo;s
not the case that they have a manager who&rsquo;s excellent in dimensions I
don&rsquo;t care about and vice versa); from discussions about this, I
would guess that a manager I think of as excellent is at least
99.9%-ile. How to find such a manager is a long discussion that I
might turn into another post.</p><p>Anyway, despite having a pretty small sample on this, I think the
mechanism for this is plausible, in that the excellent managers I
know have very high retention as well as a huge queue of people who
want to work for them, making it relatively easy for them to hire and
retain people with world-class expertise since <a href=/hiring-lemons/>the
rest of the landscape is so bleak</a>.</p><p>A more typical strategy, one that I don&rsquo;t think generally works and
also didn&rsquo;t work great for me when I tried it is to work on the most
interesting sounding and/or hardest problems around. While I did work
with some really great people while trying to
<a href=https://www.benkuhn.net/hard/>work on interesting / hard
problems</a>, including one of the best engineers I&rsquo;ve ever worked
with, I don&rsquo;t think that worked nearly as well as looking for good
management w.r.t. working with people I really want to learn from. I
believe the general problem with this algorithm is the same problem
with going to work in video games because video games are cool and/or
interesting. The fact that so many people want to work on exciting
sounding problems leads to dysfunctional environments that can
persist indefinitely.</p><p>In one case, I was on a team that had 100% turnover in nine months
and it would&rsquo;ve been six if it hadn&rsquo;t taken so long for one person to
find a team to transfer to. In the median case, my cohort (people who
joined around when I joined, ish) had about 50% YoY turnover and I
think that people had pretty good reasons for leaving. Not only is
this kind of turnover a sign that the environment is often a pretty
unhappy one, these kinds of environments often differentially cause
people who I&rsquo;d want to work with and/or learn from to leave. For
example, on the team I was on where the TL didn&rsquo;t believe in using
version control, automated testing, or pipelined designs, I worked
with Ikhwan Lee, who was great. Of course, Ikhwan left pretty quickly
while the TL stayed and is still there six years later.</p></li><li><p>Something I&rsquo;ve seen many times among my acquaintances is that people
will pick a direction before they have any idea whether or not it&rsquo;s
suitable for them. Often, after quite some time (more than a decade
in some cases), they&rsquo;ll realize that they&rsquo;re actually deeply unhappy
with the direction they&rsquo;ve gone, sometimes because it doesn&rsquo;t match
their temperament, and sometimes because it&rsquo;s something they&rsquo;re
actually bad at. In any case, wandering around randomly and finding
yourself sqrt(n) down a path you&rsquo;re happy with doesn&rsquo;t seem so bad
compared to having made it n down a path you&rsquo;re unhappy with.</p></li></ol></div></article></main><aside><div><div><h3>LATEST POSTS</h3></div><div><ul><li><a href=/notes/thought_leaders/>thought-leaders</a></li><li><a href=/bookmarks/todo_entrypoint_file/>todo entrypoint file</a></li><li><a href=/notes/nemawashi/>nemawashi</a></li><li><a href=/notes/quotes/>quotes</a></li><li><a href=/notes/conviction/>conviction</a></li></ul></div></div></aside><div id=disqus_thread></div><script type=application/javascript>window.disqus_config=function(){},function(){if(["localhost","127.0.0.1"].indexOf(window.location.hostname)!=-1){document.getElementById("disqus_thread").innerHTML="Disqus comments not available by default when the website is previewed locally.";return}var t=document,e=t.createElement("script");e.async=!0,e.src="//bartuka.disqus.com/embed.js",e.setAttribute("data-timestamp",+new Date),(t.head||t.body).appendChild(e)}()</script><noscript>Please enable JavaScript to view the <a href=https://disqus.com/?ref_noscript>comments powered by Disqus.</a></noscript><a href=https://disqus.com class=dsq-brlink>comments powered by <span class=logo-disqus>Disqus</span></a><footer><p>&copy; 2022 <a href=https://wandersoncferreira.github.io><b>Wanderson Ferreira</b></a>.
