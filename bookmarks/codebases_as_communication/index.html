<a href=/tags/bookmark>bookmark</a>
<a href=/tags/raw-page>raw-page</a><div><h2 id=computer-things>Computer Things</h2><p>Conventionally we communicate programming ideas with talks, papers, and
blog posts. But we can also communicate ideas with entire codebases. If
someone finds a security exploit, she&rsquo;ll sometimes publish a proof of
concept to prove the exploit isn&rsquo;t just theoretical.</p><p>Now let&rsquo;s say the exploit PoC comes with a ton of command-line flags:
verbose mode, configuration options, output formats, the whole works.
Now the writer is communicating something subtly different: not just
that the exploit exists, but she wants you to <em>experiment</em> with it.
She&rsquo;s making it as easy as possible for you to play with the exploit
yourself and come up with variations and consequences.</p><p>This makes codebases like any other kind of communication medium. There
are different styles you can use to say subtly different things. There
are also different “genres”, or overt things you use the codebase to
say. Some examples:</p><h3 id=of-genres>Of Genres</h3><p>This is by no means exhaustive. A codebase can:</p><ul><li>Normalize cross-language comparisons.
<a href=https://github.com/tastejs/todomvc/>TodoMVC</a> showcases the
differences between frontend frameworks, and I run
<a href=https://github.com/hwayne/lets-prove-leftpad/>Let&rsquo;s Prove Leftpad</a>
to sorta do the same with formal methods.</li><li>Platform a technique. A simple business app with lots of well-designed
property tests shows people how to use property testing. A codebase
can show what a “proper” Rails application looks like. You can also
add a complication to the codebase to show how the technique handles
it.</li><li>Make a technical statement. Show that code written in a certain style
is likely to have bugs. Or data from two different json formats,
showing what queries are easier in each format.</li><li>Make a <em>political</em> statement. Consider an NLP project that matches
writing styles of anonymous Gab accounts with verified Twitter
accounts, or one that does sentiment analysis on
<a href=https://dev.to/>dev.to</a> comments of male- vs female-authored
articles.</li><li>Show the viability of an idea. A codebase that transforms a TLA+
specification into a fixed testing suite won&rsquo;t be directly useful to
anybody, but it can inspire other people to try making their own
versions. A codebase doing lots of fun things with Word2Vec will
inspire people to play with Word2Vec.</li><li>Be funny. <a href=https://kevinkuchta.com/>Kevin Kuchta</a> is the undisputed
master of this, with things like a
<a href=https://github.com/kkuchta/TSpell>compile-time spellchecker</a> and
<a href=https://github.com/kkuchta/css-only-chat>CSS-only chat</a>.</li></ul><ul><li><p>Of Styles</p><p>Styles are qualities inside a codebase that encourages certain kinds of
reader responses. Done right, they also signal intentionality, that you
intend for those responses. Again, not exhaustive.</p><ul><li>Well-commented code encourages the reader to understand something. The
<em>something</em> could be the problem domain, the solution, a used library,
or the language itself.</li><li>You can write code to encourage <em>extraction</em>, where the reader adapts
part of the code to their own projects. You can also write it to
encourage modification, so that people fork your project and make
their own changes.</li><li>A good UI encourages <em>use</em> of the code. A set of well-documented CLI
flags, along with
<a href=https://www.gnu.org/software/bash/manual/html_node/Programmable-Completion.html>programmable
completion</a>, signal that you want people to actively use your
codebase.</li><li>A programming “flourish” showcases your own skill. A small utility
script written in Idris, a library with a Clojure transducer, a
codebase with a formal spec. When used sparingly, it shows you&rsquo;re both
competent and <em>judicious</em>. You can do cool things but aren&rsquo;t compelled
to.</li></ul><p>Repeated style patterns across codebases can communicate fundamental
values. If a company releases a lot of open source, and many of them
have a single flourish, it shows that engineers at the company get to
work with exciting technology. If everything uses TDD, it shows that the
company treats TDD as a fundamental part of the development process.</p><p>Like other forms of media, a codebase style can show unintentional
things about the author. What does it say about a programmer when their
favorite test string is “boobies”?</p></li></ul><h4 id=considerations>Considerations</h4><p>For a codebase to communicate well, the message needs to be easy to
understand. So the code layout needs to be very simple. Most production
code doesn&rsquo;t communicate well because it&rsquo;s split across files in nested
folders. That&rsquo;s hard to navigate. Try to have only a few files and make
the most important ones clear.</p><p>Boilerplate code hampers communication by adding noise to the code. If
you&rsquo;re trying to communicate something that&rsquo;s language-agnostic, use
low-boilerplate languages for the codebase.</p><p><a href=https://www.hillelwayne.com/how-do-we-trust-science-code/>Science
code</a> is often bad at communicating because it&rsquo;s a spaghetti mess
(<a href=https://gist.github.com/adiamb/79750cb13aea84c9a55c3bf95b69cc1f>example</a>).
At the same time, lots of abstractions and indirection tax the reader&rsquo;s
working memory. The code needs to be organized but not <em>too</em> organized.</p><p>If you have an intentional genre and style, you should make that clear
in a project readme. Better overexplain than underexplain. I think it
also makes sense to talk directly <em>to</em> the reader. Call out specific
lines, go into detail.</p><p>Unlike in regular programs, redundancy helps with communication.
Presenting the same thing in increasingly complex ways, or show
variations and their consequences.</p><p>All this means that communicative codebases will look different from
other kinds of code. Genre definitely; production code can also have
styles, but it&rsquo;ll be harder for the casual reader to notice them.</p><h4 id=questions-i-have-about-this>Questions I have about this</h4><ul><li>What other genres and styles are there?</li><li>What are some good communicative codebases that already exist? I only
know of examples in the comparison and joke genres.</li><li>Are there different techniques for writing communicative code?</li><li>While production code isn&rsquo;t communicative, can you have communicative
carveouts? Like a complex app that calls attention to one particular
file with a technical flourish.</li><li>How do we distinguish between intentional and unintentional stylings?
What about conspicuousness: where the author <em>wants us</em> to notice her
style?</li><li>What would a code sharing platform that specializes in communicative
code look like? Some common features like issues are less important,
some rare features like discussion boards or code annotations would be
more important.</li><li>What would a language designed for communicative projects look like?
It might seem like communication is too complex to support with
general features, but that&rsquo;s not true: “less boilerplate” is generally
better for communication. So what other features would help? A really
good CLI library? A powerful DSL builder? Are there things that would
be footguns for 100-file codebases that would be beneficial for 3-file
codebases?</li></ul></div></article></main><aside><div><div><h3>LATEST POSTS</h3></div><div><ul><li><a href=/notes/how_expert_programmers_think_about_errors/>how expert programmers think about errors</a></li><li><a href=/notes/value_and_waste_in_software_engineering/>value and waste in software engineering</a></li><li><a href=/bookmarks/todo_entrypoint_file/>todo entrypoint file</a></li><li><a href=/bookmarks/codebases_as_communication/>codebases as communication</a></li><li><a href=/notes/fundamentals/>fundamentals</a></li></ul></div></div></aside><div id=disqus_thread></div><script type=application/javascript>window.disqus_config=function(){},function(){if(["localhost","127.0.0.1"].indexOf(window.location.hostname)!=-1){document.getElementById("disqus_thread").innerHTML="Disqus comments not available by default when the website is previewed locally.";return}var t=document,e=t.createElement("script");e.async=!0,e.src="//bartuka.disqus.com/embed.js",e.setAttribute("data-timestamp",+new Date),(t.head||t.body).appendChild(e)}()</script><noscript>Please enable JavaScript to view the <a href=https://disqus.com/?ref_noscript>comments powered by Disqus.</a></noscript><a href=https://disqus.com class=dsq-brlink>comments powered by <span class=logo-disqus>Disqus</span></a><footer><p>&copy; 2022 <a href=https://wandersoncferreira.github.io><b>Wanderson Ferreira</b></a>.
