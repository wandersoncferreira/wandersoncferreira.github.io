For example, Steve Yegge has a set of blog posts where he recommends reading compiler books and learning about compilers. His reasoning is basically that, if you understand compilers, you&amp;rsquo;ll see compiler problems everywhere and will recognize all of the cases where people are solving a compiler problem without using compiler knowledge. Instead of hacking together some half-baked solution that will never work, you can apply a bit of computer science knowledge to solve the problem in a better way with less effort.</description></item><item><title>what's enlightenment?</title><link>https://wandersoncferreira.github.io/bookmarks/what_s_enlightenment/</link><pubDate>Fri, 06 May 2022 20:03:00 -0300</pubDate><guid>https://wandersoncferreira.github.io/bookmarks/what_s_enlightenment/</guid><description>Published at [Columbia Edu](http://www.columbia.edu/acis/ets/CCREAD/etscc/kant.html) Immanuel Kant Enlightenment is man&amp;rsquo;s emergence from his self-imposed nonage. Nonage is the inability to use one&amp;rsquo;s own understanding without another&amp;rsquo;s guidance. This nonage is self-imposed if its cause lies not in lack of understanding but in indecision and lack of courage to use one&amp;rsquo;s own mind without another&amp;rsquo;s guidance. Dare to know! (Sapere aude.) &amp;ldquo;Have the courage to use your own understanding,&amp;rdquo; is therefore the motto of the enlightenment.</description></item><item><title>abstraction: not what you think it is</title><link>https://wandersoncferreira.github.io/bookmarks/abstraction_not_what_you_think_it_is/</link><pubDate>Fri, 06 May 2022 13:36:00 -0300</pubDate><guid>https://wandersoncferreira.github.io/bookmarks/abstraction_not_what_you_think_it_is/</guid><description>March 28, 2022
“Interfaces are abstractions”
&amp;mdash; Olaf Thielke, the &amp;ldquo;Code Coach&amp;rdquo;
“Interfaces are not abstractions”
Mark Seeman, author of Code that Fits in Your Head and Dependency Injection
“Abstraction in programming is the process of identifying common patterns that have systematic variations; an abstraction represents the common pattern and provides a means for specifying which variation to use”

I grew up believing that following the news makes you a better citizen. Eight years after having quit, that idea now seems ridiculous&amp;mdash;that consuming a particularly unimaginative information product on a daily basis somehow makes you thoughtful and informed in a way that benefits society.
But I still encounter people who balk at the possibility of a smart, engaged adult quitting the daily news.</description></item></channel></rss>
