<p>i&rsquo;ve been thinking if the way i am currently writting my notes could be
significantly improved with little effort. my main object is to be able to
continue to collect thought in a way that does not require much structure and
formalism however i am also aware that many tools in the future could be used to
parse and extract useful <a href=https://wandersoncferreira.github.io/home/bartuka/code/roam/notes/20240915190218-reference-missing/>information</a> from these notes.</p>
<p>i want to spend a few hours searching for what is well established on this field
that could lead me to write better with few or no impediments added to my
current workflow.</p>
<p>there are a few ways to take notes:</p>
<ol>
<li>mind-mapping</li>
<li>cornell note-taking</li>
<li>outlining</li>
<li>sentence method</li>
</ol>
<p>there is also another perspective into the note system, i should go back to my
notes and reflect on it.</p>
<p>recently i decided to start my notes with a unoficial &ldquo;definition&rdquo; of the
concept of the note in the first paragraph. this has been interesting as it
cascades a good flow of reading for the note. i noticed that most of my notes
&ldquo;started from nowhere&rdquo;. if you open it, the tone of the text indicates that you
end up in the middle of something but you don&rsquo;t know what it is.</p>
<h2 id=reflecting-on-your-notes>reflecting on your notes</h2>
<p>reflecting on the notes is as important as taking the notes themselves. i should
give myself time to read over and think about how this information impacts me.</p>
<p>some questions to reflect on when reviewing the notes:</p>
<ol>
<li>why did i seek out the information in the first place?</li>
<li>did it spark something in me that i had never thought about before?</li>
<li>can i use this as a journaling prompt to get more ideas?</li>
<li>is this something i can put into <a href=https://wandersoncferreira.github.io/home/bartuka/code/roam/notes/20240915190218-reference-missing/>practice</a> as a hobby or <a href=https://wandersoncferreira.github.io/home/bartuka/code/roam/notes/20240915190218-reference-missing/>habits</a>?</li>
</ol>
<p>the best option would be to <strong>interpret</strong> and not transcribe things into the note
taking system, however it is very difficult to do this simultaneously as we
listen/read the content we are interested about. therefore, revisiting the notes
is definitely critical to improve the quality of the notes over time.</p>
<h2 id=outlining-method-for-note-taking>outlining method for note-taking</h2>
<p>this is the most common form of note-taking and it is the way i have been doing
so far in most of my notes around here.
i like this approach of structuring the ideas into a form of hierarchical tree
that help me see relationships between each bullet point.</p>
<h2 id=sentence-method-for-note-taking>sentence method for note-taking</h2>
<p>the sentence method involves recording the notes as complete sentences. with
each new idea or concept, begin a new line with a new sentence.</p>
