  Searching for patience in different contexts I found a good definition from psychology professor that believes that patience is situational form of emotion regulation, quote:
 When we feel the emotion of impatience, patience is the name of the self-regulation tools we apply to cope with that feeling. Whether that&rsquo;s self-talk, deep breaths, or preemption, those subtle or explicit self-control strategies in the face of uncertain, stressful waiting are acts of patience.">

<p>Searching for <strong>patience</strong> in different contexts I found a good definition from
psychology professor that believes that patience is situational form of emotion
regulation, quote:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>When we feel the emotion of impatience, patience is the name of the
self-regulation tools we apply to cope with that feeling. Whether that&rsquo;s
self-talk, deep breaths, or preemption, those subtle or explicit self-control
strategies in the face of uncertain, stressful waiting are acts of patience.</p>

<p>I liked the definition from Kate Sweeny because it states that patience is the
application of <a href=https://wandersoncferreira.github.io/users/wferreir/code/roam/notes/20240915190218-reference-missing/>patience strategies</a> to handle an emotion that bothers us at that
time. This is good news because it means I only need to know which are the
available strategies out there and which ones will actually work for me.</p>
<p>This answer from a Reddit user is very good as well:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><a href=https://wandersoncferreira.github.io/users/wferreir/code/roam/notes/20240915190218-reference-missing/>impatience</a> occurs when we are not accepting <a href=https://wandersoncferreira.github.io/users/wferreir/code/roam/notes/20240915190218-reference-missing/>reality</a> and have an overarching need
for <a href=https://wandersoncferreira.github.io/users/wferreir/code/roam/notes/20240915190218-reference-missing/>control</a>. for example, the cashier &ldquo;should&rdquo; be going faster at the checkout.
my kids &ldquo;should&rdquo; be quiet.</p>
<p>in order to transform those <a href=https://wandersoncferreira.github.io/users/wferreir/code/roam/notes/20240915190218-reference-missing/>stressful</a> &ldquo;shoulds&rdquo; you gotta learn to accept
how things actually are. that doesn&rsquo;t mean you can&rsquo;t do anything about
situations that are unsatisfactory. it just means you don&rsquo;t react from
<a href=https://wandersoncferreira.github.io/users/wferreir/code/roam/notes/20240915190218-reference-missing/>frustration</a> which is never a long term solution to effect real change.</p>
<p>how to accept reality?
one way is to medidate on the present moment.
another way is to try to see the situation from another point of view - for
example that slow cashier&rsquo;s. finally, begin recognizing the moment when you get
&ldquo;triggered&rdquo;, and stop to try to figure out what you are wanting to control in
the situation</p>
<p>this will help you slowly unknot the reasons for your desire to control how
things &ldquo;should&rdquo; be.</p>
<p>once you can release yourself from &ldquo;how things should be&rdquo;, you can start to act
from a more patient place.</p>
<p>good luck! this has been a big challenger for me to overcome as a parent!</p>

<p>a good way that i have found to improve that rushed part of me is to remind
myself <a href=https://wandersoncferreira.github.io/users/wferreir/code/roam/notes/20240915190218-reference-missing/>time will pass anyways</a>.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Me:</strong> i have personally done this <strong>MULTIPLE</strong> times and it is weird that this
really helped me. sometimes i even think to myself all the things i will be
doing <strong>AFTER</strong> the event i am anxious about. it&rsquo;s like reminding myself
that there is <a href=https://wandersoncferreira.github.io/users/wferreir/code/roam/notes/20240915190218-reference-missing/>life</a> afterwards.</li>
</ul>
<p>Q: for people who have great patience what&rsquo;s your secret?
A: understanding. I always assume there&rsquo;s a reason for someone being late or
behaving a certain way and that maybe that person just hasn&rsquo;t learned any better
yet. so i try to understand what&rsquo;s happening so that i can better understand
what&rsquo;s going on and empathize</p>
