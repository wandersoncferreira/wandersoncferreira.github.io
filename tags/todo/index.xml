Made by Jack B Yeats, Irish, 1871-1957.
i&amp;rsquo;ve been thinking if the way i am currently writting my notes could be significantly improved with little effort. my main object is to be able to continue to collect thought in a way that does not require much structure and formalism however i am also aware that many tools in the future could be used to parse and extract useful information from these notes.</description></item></channel></rss>
