In this post, Adam Gordon Bell discuss the advices given by thought-leaders. In his research he found the work of Philip E. Tetlock on the decision-making process of experts. Tetlock was able to split the group of experts in his research broadly in two groups: the hedgehogs and foxes.
hedgehog has one big idea like &amp;ldquo;free-market capitalism&amp;rdquo; which they use as a lens to look at many issues they are &amp;ldquo;confident forecasters&amp;rdquo; foxes they have complicated advice and were skeptical of even their own predictions less likely to be famous because their advices are harder to explain in a sound bite When all predictions were added up and scores, hedgehogs lost out to foxes.</description></item></channel></rss>
