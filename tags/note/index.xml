bad code reviews building the wrong feature or product mismanaging the backlog rework unecessarily complex solutions extraneous cognitive load psychological distress knowledge loss waiting ineffective communication human values?
maintain honour + respect for users e.g. what user information is kept, how is it shared? facilitate different origins, languages, cultures, knowledge</description></item><item><title>how expert programmers think about errors</title><link>https://wandersoncferreira.github.io/notes/how_expert_programmers_think_about_errors/</link><pubDate>Tue, 24 May 2022 21:33:00 -0300</pubDate><guid>https://wandersoncferreira.github.io/notes/how_expert_programmers_think_about_errors/</guid><description>Link of the talk.
pay attention to what is hidden attending to contrary evidence seek falsification write comments about what is not in the code: intentions and assumptions understanding by breaking re-assessing the landscape and deliberately expanding the search space sometimes a high performance team avoids using methodologies playing methods against each other building errors into the code to verify the test suite etc the interplay between developers is crucial experts use disciplined practices that are socially embedded and reinforced contrasting multiple perspectives fixes the problem and not worries about the blame</description></item></channel></rss>
