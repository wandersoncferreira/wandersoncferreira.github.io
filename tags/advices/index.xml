For example, Steve Yegge has a set of blog posts where he recommends reading compiler books and learning about compilers. His reasoning is basically that, if you understand compilers, you&amp;rsquo;ll see compiler problems everywhere and will recognize all of the cases where people are solving a compiler problem without using compiler knowledge. Instead of hacking together some half-baked solution that will never work, you can apply a bit of computer science knowledge to solve the problem in a better way with less effort.</description></item><item><title>what's enlightenment?</title><link>https://wandersoncferreira.github.io/bookmarks/what_s_enlightenment/</link><pubDate>Sun, 15 May 2022 08:10:00 -0300</pubDate><guid>https://wandersoncferreira.github.io/bookmarks/what_s_enlightenment/</guid><description>Published at [Columbia Edu](http://www.columbia.edu/acis/ets/CCREAD/etscc/kant.html) Immanuel Kant Enlightenment is man&amp;rsquo;s emergence from his self-imposed nonage. Nonage is the inability to use one&amp;rsquo;s own understanding without another&amp;rsquo;s guidance. This nonage is self-imposed if its cause lies not in lack of understanding but in indecision and lack of courage to use one&amp;rsquo;s own mind without another&amp;rsquo;s guidance. Dare to know! (Sapere aude.) &amp;ldquo;Have the courage to use your own understanding,&amp;rdquo; is therefore the motto of the enlightenment.</description></item></channel></rss>
